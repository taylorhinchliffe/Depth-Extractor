# Depth Extractor

## Description:
This simple MacOS prototype allows the user to easily view depth information from portrait photos in a 3D environment.

## Installation:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Depth-Extractor.git
2. Open the Xcode project file 3D Image Capture V1.xcodeproj
3. Build and run the project in Xcode.

## Usage:
1. Take an iPhone image in portrait mode. 
2. Concert the image to .heic format. 
3. Run the app and click "load photo".

## Best Practices:
1. Depth information can be scaled within the Xcode project, in the renderPixelSquares function, at the line "let depthScale: Float = ___". 
Try ranges such as 100 to 10,000.
